		   <http://www.mhonarc.org/>

I would like to thank everyone who has given feedback on MHonArc.

track of all the names.  However, I'd like to give special thanks to
the following:

      [If you know of someone left out that deserves mentioning,
       please send a message to mhonarc@mhonarc.org.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A. P. Barrett <barrett@ee.und.ac.za>
	For developing a base64 library in pure Perl.  The library
	has been adapted to decode base64 messages by MHonArc.

 A.R. Burgers <burgers@ecn.nl>
	For contributing the prsfrom.pl program (included in the
	extras/ directory).

 Susie Blackstock <seads@rsn.hp.com>
	For helping me with the documentation.  Any problems with the
	documentation is purely my fault.  And she's cute too.

 Achim Bohnet <ach@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
	For his help in testing, and contributing to, mhonarc and for
	setting up, and maintaining, the first mhonarc mailing list.
	Even though list ownership has changed, he still maintains
	a very useful archive of the list.

 Jeff Breidenbach <jeff@jab.org>
	For his feedback and his usage of MHonArc at a scale that
	it was really never designed for,
	<http://www.mail-archive.com/>, to influence the development
	MHonArc (which still has scalability problems :-)

 Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
	For his help with the MosaicMail script.

 Timothy Finin <Tim.Finin@cs.umbc.edu>
	Whose initial feedback on mbox2html (my first mail->HTML
	program) caused the ball rolling on developing a more complete
	mail-to-HTML program.

 Stephen Franklin <franklin@uci.edu>
	For providing the machine facilities for housing the first
	MHonArc home page:
	<http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html>.  Location
	still functions a primary mirror/backup for MHonArc.

 Ken Harward <harward@convex.com>
	For helping me tackle Perl problems and for bouncing ideas
	off.

 Phyllis Imperatrice <mymom@home>
	For the initial sketch of the MHonArc logo.

 Eddie Kohler <kohler@aciri.org>
	Provided useful set of patches and ideas to spark
	improvements in index ordering, thread slice formatting, and
	other features.

 Christoper Lindsey <lindsey@ncsa.uiuc.edu>
	For providing hosting services for mhonarc.org and for
	taking over administration responsibilities of the mhonarc
	mailing list.

 Frank J. Manion <FJ_Manion@fccc.edu>
	For his contributions in improving date parsing.

	For his great help in getting MHonArc to run under MS-DOS, and
	for his help in trouble-shooting.

 Achille Petrilli <Achille.Petrilli@MACMAIL.CERN.CH>
	For his initial patches for MacPerl support to get the
	ball rolling for MacPerl usage.

 John C. Ring, Jr. <jcring@switch.com>
	For tipping me off on how <img src> can be used by spammers,
	which lead me to update mhtxthtml.pl to address this abuse.

 NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@mri.co.jp>
	For the contribution of a text/plain filter to process
	ISO-2022 encoded mail messages (ie. Japanese character set).
