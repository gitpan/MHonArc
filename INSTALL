INSTALL for MHonArc
===================
<URL:http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE  Please read RELNOTES before installing MHonArc for any
	  news about compatibility with previous versions and/or
	  important usage information.

    NOTE  Installation has changed slightly from 1.x releases.  Please
          read the following instructions if you are familiar with
          the 1.x installation process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document gives the basic method for installing MHonArc on a
Unix or MS-DOS/Windows system.  Please read this entire document
before installation.

Instructions
------------

    Interactive Installing:

        Run the following command:

            perl install.me

        The installation program will ask you a series of questions on
        where the Perl executable is and where to put MHonArc files.
        Just hit <CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

    Batch Install:

        1. Edit the file 'install.cfg'.  Knowledge of Perl is helpful.
        2. Run the following command:

            perl install.me batch

        The installation program will output information on what
        is being installed and where it is being installed.

Notes on Installation Program
-----------------------------

    o The '#!' line in the installed mhonarc program is set to
      point to the Perl executable specified in the installation
      process (this has no meaning under MS-DOS).

    o The installed mhonarc program has code added so it will find
      its default libraries specified in the installation program.
      I.e.  The install lib directory is added to mhonarc's search
      path so it will find its libraries.

    o If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
      program will create the path ONLY if running in interactive
      mode.  If running in batch mode, you must check that all paths
      specified exist.


Windows Notes
-------------

    o You many need to create a batch file for easy invocation of
      MHonArc.  An example batch file exists in the bat/ directory of
      the distribution.

    o Note, on WinNT, you can rename the installed "mhonarc" program
      to "mhonarc.pl" if the appropriate registry entries exist for
      associating ".pl" files with perl (this should have been done
      when perl was installed).  Therefore, you can invoke MHonArc
      from anywhere as long as "mhonarc.pl" is in your search path
      (you will need to use "mhonarc.pl" -- include the ".pl" --
      to invoke MHonArc).

    o In the logo/ directory of the distribution is a BMP file
      "mhaicon.bmp".  You can copy the image into your Windows Icon
      directory.  Then through the file types editor of the file
      explorer, you can specify mhaicon.bmp as the icon for MHonArc
      resource (.mrc) files.


Resource File Editing
---------------------

If you are Vim user, <URL:http://www.vim.org/>, a syntax file
for MHonArc resource files is included in the examples directory
(mhonarc.vim).  Vim is known to run on a variety of operating systems,
and is free software.

To use mhonarc.vim, copy mhonarc.vim to an appropriate location
and add something like the following to your .vimrc file:

au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mrc	so $HOME/share/vim/syntax/mhonarc.vim

Of course, change the pathname to mhonarc.vim to where ever you copied
it to.

Now, any file with ".mrc" extension will put Vim into MHonArc resource
file highlighting mode.  The mode is best used with color-capable
terminals.
