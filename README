DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation for MHonArc is located in the doc/ directory.
    The main documentation for MHonArc is in multiple HTML files.
    Load index.html in the doc/ directory into your Web browser to
    get started.

    Filenames of the documentation do NOT follow the 8.3 convention.
    Therefore, you will need a filesystem that supports long names
    to read the documentation locally.

    Some tables are used in the documentation.  Therefore, having
    a table-capable viewer is beneficial, but not essential.

    forum for users and developers.  The list is the main source for

    If you are so inclined, feel free to send the author a donation
    if you feel guilty on using a program that that cost you nothing,
    but some poor soul sweated over.  The author is more than happy
    to provide address information to prospective donors inorder to
    ease their conscience.  Plus, requests from donars are more likely
    to get more timely responses ;-) and help insure the continued
    development of the program.
